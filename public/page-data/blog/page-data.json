However, it is also\nimportant to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as\nindividuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-\nbullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or\ndeal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power\nimbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances\ninclude being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the\nclub/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p>Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of\nknowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)\nhave a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their\nparticipants.\nNCD is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will not be tolerated at this club.</p>\n<p>Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of NCD.\nThis policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical</strong> - hitting, kicking, theft of belongings, damage to belongings or use of\nimplements to deliberately cause harm.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbal</strong> - threats, name calling, deliberately spreading damaging rumours, sarcasm,\nswearing, persistent teasing, ridiculing, demeaning, taunting a pupil, insulting\nsomeone’s appearance/ abilities/ disabilities/ achievements/ families.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion based</strong> - religious taunts.</li>\n<li><strong>Indirect</strong> - social exclusion or rejection, graffiti, gestures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sexual</strong> - unwanted physical contact, abusive comments, name calling, use of\nsexualised language, sexting, homophobic name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Racist</strong> - racist taunting or name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber bullying</strong> - use of the internet or other electronic communication. Texting, (calls\nor images), tweets, blogs, forums, chat rooms and use of social networking to hurt,\nharass, embarrass, demean, provoke or humiliate another using perceived\nanonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile phones and social networking websites/ applications such as Snapchat, Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube can be used for negative purposes and misuse\ncan lead to involvement from the PSNI.</strong></p>\n<h2>How Bullying Affects the Target/Victim</h2>\n<p>Bullied children will not always be prepared to tell those in authority. However, when a disclosure is\nmade, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words\nare of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat\nthe case as bullying. Bullying can result in a decrease in the victim’s capacity to learn and develop.</p>\n<h2>Signs of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwillingness to come to class.</li>\n<li>Withdrawn, isolated behaviour.</li>\n<li>Refusal to talk about problems.</li>\n<li>Complaining about missing possessions.</li>\n<li>Avoiding interaction with peers, such as hanging back on breaks.</li>\n<li>Nail biting, flinching, jumpiness, distracted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Illness caused by stress, loss of sleep and change in eating habits.</li>\n<li>Out of character aggression or temper.</li>\n<li>Attempts to inflict harm on them self.\n(These behaviours can be symptomatic of other problems, that aren’t bullying related).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consequences of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bullying can have detrimental effects on the victim. NCD staff will do everything they can to ensure\nincidents of bullying are not repeated. Incidents of bullying could result in the bully:</li>\n<li>Being given targets to improve their unsociable behaviour.</li>\n<li>Both children being interviewed to determine the form of bullying.</li>\n<li>Support to both the victim and the bully, to improve their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Repeated incidents of serious bullying could result in the removal of the bully from class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we aim to help the target/ victim</h2>\n<p>NCD has a responsibility to create a supportive and disciplined environment which will foster the\nindividual development and caring for children and young people. NCD aims to do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a supportive environment</li>\n<li>By taking bullying and the impact of bullying seriously.</li>\n<li>Bullying investigations will involve both the bully and the bullied and will aim to resolve\nthese issues as best as possible.</li>\n<li>The bullied individual must be supported.</li>\n<li>The bully will be supported in recognising their unsociable behaviour and provided support\nto improve and modify their behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The club will</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take all bullying problems seriously.</li>\n<li>Investigate all incidents thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Insure bullies and victims are interviewed separately.</li>\n<li>Obtain witness information.</li>\n<li>Inform staff about incidents involving NCD athletes.</li>\n<li>Ensure action is taken to prevent further bullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Such actions may include</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining an apology.</li>\n<li>Informing parents of the bullied and the bully.</li>\n<li>Provide support for both the bully and the victim.</li>\n<li>Mediation between the bully and victim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Role and responsibility surrounding bullying</h2>\n<h3>Roles of coaches, volunteers and staff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage athletes to have self confidence, positive self esteem, self respect and respect for\nothers.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate by example the high standard of social and personal behaviour we expect from\nour athletes.</li>\n<li>Discuss bullying with their classes to ensure athletes understand bullying, the consequences\nof bullying and the importance of telling an adult.</li>\n<li>Be alert to signs of distress and bullying.</li>\n<li>Listen to children/ young people who have been bullied, always take what they say seriously,\nrecord and act to support and protect them.</li>\n<li>Talk with the child accused of bullying to determine the nature of bullying.</li>\n<li>Report suspected cases of bullying to the head coach or child protection officer.</li>\n<li>Follow up any complaint from a parent on bullying and report back promptly with a report\non what action has been taken.</li>\n<li>Deal with incidents of bullying promptly and effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Responsibility of Athletes</h2>\n<p>Pupils in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the rules of Nemesis Cheer and Dance.</li>\n<li>Refrain from becoming involved in any type of bullying, in or outside of NCD classes, even\nwhen risking temporary unpopularity.</li>\n<li>Intervene to protect other children/ young people from bullying, unless unsafe to do so.</li>\n<li>Report to coaches any instance of witnesses or suspected bullying.</li>\n<li>Help create a climate where bullying is unacceptable.</li>\n<li>Value and respect everyone, other athletes, coaches, staff and volunteers.</li>\n<li>Help and support the achievements of others.</li>\n<li>Keep others safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victims of bullying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to suffer in silence.

There are four main types of abuse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neglect which includes failing to protect a child from exposure to any kind of danger, such\nas, starvation or cold. Neglect also includes persistent failure to carry out aspects of care,\nresulting in significant impairment of a child’s health or development.</li>\n<li>Physical injury which is deliberately inflicted, such as, biting, beating, burning or scalding.\nThis can also be a result of wilful neglect failing to prevent the child from being injured.</li>\n<li>Emotional abuse is any form of emotional ill treatment or rejection. Resulting in in-adverse\neffects emotional, physical and/or behavioural development of the child. This includes\nconstant criticism, continuously withholding approval or affection, severe discipline or a\ncomplete lack of appropriate control.</li>\n<li>Sexual abuse is the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents by involving them in\nsexual activities which they do not comprehend, are unable to give informed consent or\nviolate the social taboos of family roles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bullying</h2>\n<p>Bullying is a highly distressing and damaging form of abuse and is not tolerated at NCD. All staff and\nvolunteers are vigilant to signs of bullying and will take immediate steps to stop it happening,\nprotect and reassure the victim.</p>\n<p>Further guidance is available on bullying in our Anti-Bullying Policy.</p>\n<h2>Protection of Staff and Children</h2>\n<p>NCD recognises it’s responsibility to children, young people who take part in classes, as well as, staff\nand volunteers working with them. All members of staff, coaches and volunteers will be made aware\nof their responsibilities and what is expected of them. This includes the ode of conduct and\nbehaviour they are expected follow, the line of accountability in the organisation and the procedures\nthat need to be followed if there is an allegation of abuse.</p>\n<p>Parents are expected to work alongside coaches, staff and volunteers in relation to any concerns\nabout the behaviour of their child or young person. Dangerous or offensive behaviour of a child or\nyoung person, will be brought to the attention of the parents and persistent concerns could lead to\nthe suspension and removal of the child or young person from classes and their team.</p>\n<p>NCD is in receipt of public liability insurance covering accidents and allegations of harm cause by\ntheir coaches.</p>\n<p>The safety and protection of children is the responsibility of all involved, including coaches,\nvolunteers, junior coaches and parents. The aim of NCD is to work together to the children and\nyoung people participating in classes will be given the best possible opportunities and ensure they\nhave the best possible safe guards against accident or harm, while allowing them to grow\nemotionally.</p>\n<h2>How Abuse Comes to Light</h2>\n<p>Staff can become aware of abuse through direct disclosure of the victim, through someone the\nvictim has confided in passes this information on. This is second hand information and can be more\ncomplicated. Allegations can also arise through rumour or overheard comments. Each of these have\ntheir involvement different considerations. Any allegations of abuse should be made to the\ndesignated child protection officer.\nOn receiving allegations of abuse\nIf a coach, volunteer or other member of staff receives a disclosure of abuse from a child, or a report\nfrom a third party (including another child) or observed behaviour or a conversation which causes\nconcern that abuse may have occurred, it is their responsibility to act to ensure protection of the\nchild.</p>\n<p><strong>If you suspect abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, for reasons other than being told</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should report your concerns to the designated child protection officer or if unavailable\nthe coach in charge of the session. To discuss your concerns.</li>\n<li>Record your concerns as quickly as possible, to help with accuracy of timing later.</li>\n<li>The child protection officer should contact social services to seek their advice and decide on\nhow to contact the police and contact any other necessary child protection agencies. If for\nsome reason this is not done by the protection officer you should do this yourself.</li>\n<li>Appropriate records should be kept by the child protection officer you may need to assist\nthem in completing these.</li>\n<li>Do not investigate further, leave this to child protection professionals, who will follow\nappropriate guidelines, who may wish to speak to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If a child reports allegations of abuse to you or gives you information about possible abuse of another child or vulnerable adult</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listen respectfully and carefully, accepting the information at face value, always believe\na child confiding in you.</li>\n<li>Allow the child to speak without interrupting or attempting to investigate.</li>\n<li>Support the child for giving you this information (to alleviate feelings of discomfort),\npass no judgement on what you have heard.</li>\n<li>Inform the child that you will offer them as much support as possible but that you will\nhave to pass this information on to the child protection officer or relevant authorities.</li>\n<li>Inform the child protection of what you have been told as soon as the situation warrants\nto ensure appropriate action can be taken.</li>\n<li>Record everything the child/ vulnerable adult said, as quickly as possible in as much\ndetail as possible. The child’s first disclosure is hearsay but is admissible as evidence in\ncourt and you will be interviewed by a child protection professional, about what you\nwere told. Therefore, accurate recordings are necessary.</li>\n<li>The child protection officer or failing that the coaching leading the session will inform\nparents/ guardians of the concerns, unless the child objects or a close family member is\nthe alleged offender. In which case the child protection officer will coordinate with social\nservices and the police in how to advise the parents/ guardian of the concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Never tell the child/ vulnerable adult</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>That you won’t tell anyone something they are about to disclose to you. You have a\nresponsibility to follow necessary guidelines and pass this on to the designated child\nprotection officer.</li>\n<li>You cannot promise a child that the abuse will never happen again, because again you\ncannot make false promises to a child and you cannot guarantee this.</li>\n<li>If a child shows lacerations, bruises etc you can sketch these, but under no lint should a\nchild’s clothing be removed.</li>\n<li>Do not interrupt the child while they are disclosing information to you and while tactile\nenquires can be made, you should not enquire to deeply. This is for child protection\nprofessionals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who to contact during allegations of abuse</h2>\n<p>Following concerns or allegations of abuse, the coach or volunteer will coordinate with the child\nprotection officer, who will report the facts as known to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coleraine Childcare office, Castlerock Road, Coleraine. 70352221</li>\n<li>Ballymoney childcare team, Newall Road, Ballymoney. 27664101</li>\n<li>The Out of Hours Social Work Service. 94468833</li>\n<li>Coleraine Police Care Unit. 70344122</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advice given by these respective professionals should then be followed.</p>\n<h2>Independent Professional Advisor</h2>\n<p>In all cases NCD may wish to avail outside professional advice, without using identifying information,\nto help establish what is the safest and most balanced way of managing any specific situation that\nmay arise.</p>\n<h2>Recruitment of Volunteers/ Junior Coaches</h2>\n<p>Any individual who wishes to participate as a volunteer or junior coach in any NCD classes or\nactivities must complete the application form, supplied on request, providing the information\nrequired.
