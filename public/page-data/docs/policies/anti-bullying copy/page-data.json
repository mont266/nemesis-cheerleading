However, it is also\nimportant to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as\nindividuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-\nbullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or\ndeal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power\nimbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances\ninclude being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the\nclub/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p>Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of\nknowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)\nhave a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their\nparticipants.\nNCD is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will not be tolerated at this club.</p>\n<p>Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of NCD.\nThis policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical</strong> - hitting, kicking, theft of belongings, damage to belongings or use of\nimplements to deliberately cause harm.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbal</strong> - threats, name calling, deliberately spreading damaging rumours, sarcasm,\nswearing, persistent teasing, ridiculing, demeaning, taunting a pupil, insulting\nsomeone’s appearance/ abilities/ disabilities/ achievements/ families.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion based</strong> - religious taunts.</li>\n<li><strong>Indirect</strong> - social exclusion or rejection, graffiti, gestures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sexual</strong> - unwanted physical contact, abusive comments, name calling, use of\nsexualised language, sexting, homophobic name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Racist</strong> - racist taunting or name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber bullying</strong> - use of the internet or other electronic communication. Texting, (calls\nor images), tweets, blogs, forums, chat rooms and use of social networking to hurt,\nharass, embarrass, demean, provoke or humiliate another using perceived\nanonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile phones and social networking websites/ applications such as Snapchat, Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube can be used for negative purposes and misuse\ncan lead to involvement from the PSNI.</strong></p>\n<h2>How Bullying Affects the Target/Victim</h2>\n<p>Bullied children will not always be prepared to tell those in authority. However, when a disclosure is\nmade, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words\nare of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat\nthe case as bullying. Bullying can result in a decrease in the victim’s capacity to learn and develop.</p>\n<h2>Signs of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwillingness to come to class.</li>\n<li>Withdrawn, isolated behaviour.</li>\n<li>Refusal to talk about problems.</li>\n<li>Complaining about missing possessions.</li>\n<li>Avoiding interaction with peers, such as hanging back on breaks.</li>\n<li>Nail biting, flinching, jumpiness, distracted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Illness caused by stress, loss of sleep and change in eating habits.</li>\n<li>Out of character aggression or temper.</li>\n<li>Attempts to inflict harm on them self.\n(These behaviours can be symptomatic of other problems, that aren’t bullying related).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consequences of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bullying can have detrimental effects on the victim. NCD staff will do everything they can to ensure\nincidents of bullying are not repeated. Incidents of bullying could result in the bully:</li>\n<li>Being given targets to improve their unsociable behaviour.</li>\n<li>Both children being interviewed to determine the form of bullying.</li>\n<li>Support to both the victim and the bully, to improve their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Repeated incidents of serious bullying could result in the removal of the bully from class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we aim to help the target/ victim</h2>\n<p>NCD has a responsibility to create a supportive and disciplined environment which will foster the\nindividual development and caring for children and young people. NCD aims to do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a supportive environment</li>\n<li>By taking bullying and the impact of bullying seriously.</li>\n<li>Bullying investigations will involve both the bully and the bullied and will aim to resolve\nthese issues as best as possible.</li>\n<li>The bullied individual must be supported.</li>\n<li>The bully will be supported in recognising their unsociable behaviour and provided support\nto improve and modify their behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The club will</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take all bullying problems seriously.</li>\n<li>Investigate all incidents thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Insure bullies and victims are interviewed separately.</li>\n<li>Obtain witness information.</li>\n<li>Inform staff about incidents involving NCD athletes.</li>\n<li>Ensure action is taken to prevent further bullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Such actions may include</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining an apology.</li>\n<li>Informing parents of the bullied and the bully.</li>\n<li>Provide support for both the bully and the victim.</li>\n<li>Mediation between the bully and victim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Role and responsibility surrounding bullying</h2>\n<h3>Roles of coaches, volunteers and staff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage athletes to have self confidence, positive self esteem, self respect and respect for\nothers.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate by example the high standard of social and personal behaviour we expect from\nour athletes.</li>\n<li>Discuss bullying with their classes to ensure athletes understand bullying, the consequences\nof bullying and the importance of telling an adult.</li>\n<li>Be alert to signs of distress and bullying.</li>\n<li>Listen to children/ young people who have been bullied, always take what they say seriously,\nrecord and act to support and protect them.</li>\n<li>Talk with the child accused of bullying to determine the nature of bullying.</li>\n<li>Report suspected cases of bullying to the head coach or child protection officer.</li>\n<li>Follow up any complaint from a parent on bullying and report back promptly with a report\non what action has been taken.</li>\n<li>Deal with incidents of bullying promptly and effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Responsibility of Athletes</h2>\n<p>Pupils in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the rules of Nemesis Cheer and Dance.</li>\n<li>Refrain from becoming involved in any type of bullying, in or outside of NCD classes, even\nwhen risking temporary unpopularity.</li>\n<li>Intervene to protect other children/ young people from bullying, unless unsafe to do so.</li>\n<li>Report to coaches any instance of witnesses or suspected bullying.</li>\n<li>Help create a climate where bullying is unacceptable.</li>\n<li>Value and respect everyone, other athletes, coaches, staff and volunteers.</li>\n<li>Help and support the achievements of others.</li>\n<li>Keep others safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victims of bullying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to suffer in silence.

To add a callout to your documentation simply add the following <code>html</code> code with class <code>important</code> or <code>note</code>. Like in the example bellow. </p>\n<h3>HTML example</h3>\n<p>Copy the code and modify these blocks according to your needs.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div class=\"important\">\n  &#x3C;strong>Important:&#x3C;/strong> \n  This is an \"Important\" callout block of text.\n  This block indicates a warning or caution. \n  Use it for an important message. \n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div class=\"note\">\n  &#x3C;strong>Note:&#x3C;/strong> \n  This is a \"Note\" callout block of text. \n  This block signifies a general note.\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Live example</h3>\n<div class=\"important\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong> \n  This is an \"Important\" callout block of text. \n  This block indicates a warning or caution.\n  Use it for an important message. \n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong> \n  This is an \"Note\" callout block of text. \n  This block signifies a general note.\n</div>\n<h2>Code blocks</h2>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"note\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  Code blocks have copy functionality. To copy the code press the grey button located in the right side top corner.\n</div>\n<p>You can create simple code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>`<code></code></code> before and after the code block. To render a code block more readable, we recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks.</p>\n<pre>```\nif (condition) {\n  code to run if condition is true\n} else {\n  run some other code instead\n}\n```\n</pre>\n<pre><code>if (condition) {\n  code to run if condition is true\n} else {\n  run some other code instead\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>\n<p>You can add a language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your code block. For example, to syntax highlight <strong>JavaScript</strong> code, specify <code>javascript</code> next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:</p>\n<pre>\n```javascript\nif (condition) {\n  code to run if condition is true\n} else {\n  run some other code instead\n}\n```\n</pre>\n<p>The rendered output looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (condition) {\n  code to run if condition is true\n} else {\n  run some other code instead\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Tables</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information.

However, it is also\nimportant to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as\nindividuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-\nbullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or\ndeal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power\nimbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances\ninclude being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the\nclub/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p>Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of\nknowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)\nhave a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their\nparticipants.\nNCD is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will not be tolerated at this club.</p>\n<p>Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of NCD.\nThis policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical</strong> - hitting, kicking, theft of belongings, damage to belongings or use of\nimplements to deliberately cause harm.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbal</strong> - threats, name calling, deliberately spreading damaging rumours, sarcasm,\nswearing, persistent teasing, ridiculing, demeaning, taunting a pupil, insulting\nsomeone’s appearance/ abilities/ disabilities/ achievements/ families.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion based</strong> - religious taunts.</li>\n<li><strong>Indirect</strong> - social exclusion or rejection, graffiti, gestures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sexual</strong> - unwanted physical contact, abusive comments, name calling, use of\nsexualised language, sexting, homophobic name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Racist</strong> - racist taunting or name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber bullying</strong> - use of the internet or other electronic communication. Texting, (calls\nor images), tweets, blogs, forums, chat rooms and use of social networking to hurt,\nharass, embarrass, demean, provoke or humiliate another using perceived\nanonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile phones and social networking websites/ applications such as Snapchat, Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube can be used for negative purposes and misuse\ncan lead to involvement from the PSNI.</strong></p>\n<h2>How Bullying Affects the Target/Victim</h2>\n<p>Bullied children will not always be prepared to tell those in authority. However, when a disclosure is\nmade, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words\nare of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat\nthe case as bullying. Bullying can result in a decrease in the victim’s capacity to learn and develop.</p>\n<h2>Signs of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwillingness to come to class.</li>\n<li>Withdrawn, isolated behaviour.</li>\n<li>Refusal to talk about problems.</li>\n<li>Complaining about missing possessions.</li>\n<li>Avoiding interaction with peers, such as hanging back on breaks.</li>\n<li>Nail biting, flinching, jumpiness, distracted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Illness caused by stress, loss of sleep and change in eating habits.</li>\n<li>Out of character aggression or temper.</li>\n<li>Attempts to inflict harm on them self.\n(These behaviours can be symptomatic of other problems, that aren’t bullying related).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consequences of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bullying can have detrimental effects on the victim. NCD staff will do everything they can to ensure\nincidents of bullying are not repeated. Incidents of bullying could result in the bully:</li>\n<li>Being given targets to improve their unsociable behaviour.</li>\n<li>Both children being interviewed to determine the form of bullying.</li>\n<li>Support to both the victim and the bully, to improve their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Repeated incidents of serious bullying could result in the removal of the bully from class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we aim to help the target/ victim</h2>\n<p>NCD has a responsibility to create a supportive and disciplined environment which will foster the\nindividual development and caring for children and young people. NCD aims to do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a supportive environment</li>\n<li>By taking bullying and the impact of bullying seriously.</li>\n<li>Bullying investigations will involve both the bully and the bullied and will aim to resolve\nthese issues as best as possible.</li>\n<li>The bullied individual must be supported.</li>\n<li>The bully will be supported in recognising their unsociable behaviour and provided support\nto improve and modify their behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The club will</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take all bullying problems seriously.</li>\n<li>Investigate all incidents thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Insure bullies and victims are interviewed separately.</li>\n<li>Obtain witness information.</li>\n<li>Inform staff about incidents involving NCD athletes.</li>\n<li>Ensure action is taken to prevent further bullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Such actions may include</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining an apology.</li>\n<li>Informing parents of the bullied and the bully.</li>\n<li>Provide support for both the bully and the victim.</li>\n<li>Mediation between the bully and victim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Role and responsibility surrounding bullying</h2>\n<h3>Roles of coaches, volunteers and staff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage athletes to have self confidence, positive self esteem, self respect and respect for\nothers.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate by example the high standard of social and personal behaviour we expect from\nour athletes.</li>\n<li>Discuss bullying with their classes to ensure athletes understand bullying, the consequences\nof bullying and the importance of telling an adult.</li>\n<li>Be alert to signs of distress and bullying.</li>\n<li>Listen to children/ young people who have been bullied, always take what they say seriously,\nrecord and act to support and protect them.</li>\n<li>Talk with the child accused of bullying to determine the nature of bullying.</li>\n<li>Report suspected cases of bullying to the head coach or child protection officer.</li>\n<li>Follow up any complaint from a parent on bullying and report back promptly with a report\non what action has been taken.</li>\n<li>Deal with incidents of bullying promptly and effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Responsibility of Athletes</h2>\n<p>Pupils in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the rules of Nemesis Cheer and Dance.</li>\n<li>Refrain from becoming involved in any type of bullying, in or outside of NCD classes, even\nwhen risking temporary unpopularity.</li>\n<li>Intervene to protect other children/ young people from bullying, unless unsafe to do so.</li>\n<li>Report to coaches any instance of witnesses or suspected bullying.</li>\n<li>Help create a climate where bullying is unacceptable.</li>\n<li>Value and respect everyone, other athletes, coaches, staff and volunteers.</li>\n<li>Help and support the achievements of others.</li>\n<li>Keep others safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victims of bullying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to suffer in silence.

However, it is also\nimportant to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as\nindividuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-\nbullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or\ndeal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power\nimbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances\ninclude being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the\nclub/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p>Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of\nknowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)\nhave a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their\nparticipants.\nNCD is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will not be tolerated at this club.</p>\n<p>Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of NCD.\nThis policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical</strong> - hitting, kicking, theft of belongings, damage to belongings or use of\nimplements to deliberately cause harm.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbal</strong> - threats, name calling, deliberately spreading damaging rumours, sarcasm,\nswearing, persistent teasing, ridiculing, demeaning, taunting a pupil, insulting\nsomeone’s appearance/ abilities/ disabilities/ achievements/ families.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion based</strong> - religious taunts.</li>\n<li><strong>Indirect</strong> - social exclusion or rejection, graffiti, gestures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sexual</strong> - unwanted physical contact, abusive comments, name calling, use of\nsexualised language, sexting, homophobic name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Racist</strong> - racist taunting or name calling.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber bullying</strong> - use of the internet or other electronic communication.

However, when a disclosure is\nmade, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words\nare of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat\nthe case as bullying.
