However, it is also\nimportant to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as\nindividuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-\nbullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or\ndeal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power\nimbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances\ninclude being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the\nclub/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p>Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of\nknowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)\nhave a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their\nparticipants.</p>\n<p><strong>Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)</strong> is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will\nnot be tolerated at this club. Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of\nNCD.</p>\n<p>This policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bullying</h2>\n<p>The main types of bullying are (this is not an exhaustive list)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical- hitting, kicking, theft of belongings, damage to belongings or use of\nimplements to deliberately cause harm.</li>\n<li>Verbal- threats, name calling, deliberately spreading damaging rumours, sarcasm,\nswearing, persistent teasing, ridiculing, demeaning, taunting a pupil, insulting\nsomeone’s appearance/ abilities/ disabilities/ achievements/ families.</li>\n<li>Religion based- religious taunts.</li>\n<li>Indirect- social exclusion or rejection, graffiti, gestures.</li>\n<li>Sexual- unwanted physical contact, abusive comments, name calling, use of\nsexualised language, sexting, homophobic name calling.</li>\n<li>Racist- racist taunting or name calling.</li>\n<li>Cyber bullying- use of the internet or other electronic communication. Texting, (calls\nor images), tweets, blogs, forums, chat rooms and use of social networking to hurt,\nharass, embarrass, demean, provoke or humiliate another using perceived\nanonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mobile phones and social networking websites/ applications such as Snapchat, Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube can be used for negative purposes and misuse\ncan lead to involvement from the PSNI.</p>\n<h2>How Bullying Affects the Target/ Victim?</h2>\n<p>Bullied children will not always be prepared to tell those in authority. However, when a disclosure is\nmade, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words\nare of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat\nthe case as bullying. Bullying can result in a decrease in the victim’s capacity to learn and develop.</p>\n<h2>Signs of Bullying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unwillingness to come to class.</li>\n<li>Withdrawn, isolated behaviour.</li>\n<li>Refusal to talk about problems.</li>\n<li>Complaining about missing possessions.</li>\n<li>Avoiding interaction with peers, such as hanging back on breaks.</li>\n<li>Nail biting, flinching, jumpiness, distracted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Illness caused by stress, loss of sleep and change in eating habits.</li>\n<li>Out of character aggression or temper.</li>\n<li>Attempts to inflict harm on them self.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(These behaviours can be symptomatic of other problems, that aren’t bullying related).\nConsequences of bullying</p>\n<p>Bullying can have detrimental effects on the victim. NCD staff will do everything they can to ensure\nincidents of bullying are not repeated. Incidents of bullying could result in the bully:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being given targets to improve their unsociable behaviour.</li>\n<li>Both children being interviewed to determine the form of bullying.</li>\n<li>Support to the victim. As well as the bully, to improve their behaviour.</li>\n<li>Repeated incidents of serious bullying could result in the removal of the bully from class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we aim to help the target/ victim</h2>\n<p>NCD has a responsibility to create a supportive and disciplined environment which will foster the\nindividual development and caring for children and young people. </p>\n<h4>NCD aims to do this by:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a supportive environment</li>\n<li>By taking bullying and the impact of bullying seriously.</li>\n<li>Bullying investigations will involve both the bully and the bullied and will aim to resolve\nthese issues as best as possible.</li>\n<li>The bullied individual must be supported.</li>\n<li>The bully will be supported in recognising their unsociable behaviour and provided support\nto improve and modify their behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The club will</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Take all bullying problems seriously.</li>\n<li>Investigate all incidents thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Insure bullies and victims are interviewed separately.</li>\n<li>Obtain witness information.</li>\n<li>Inform staff about incidents involving NCD athletes.</li>\n<li>Ensure action is taken to prevent further bullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Such actions may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining an apology.</li>\n<li>Informing parents of the bullied and the bully.</li>\n<li>Provide support for both the bully and the victim.</li>\n<li>Mediation between the bully and victim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Role and responsibility surrounding bullying</h2>\n<h3>Roles of coaches, volunteers and staff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage athletes to have self confidence, positive self esteem, self respect and respect for\nothers.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate by example the high standard of social and personal behaviour we expect from\nour athletes.</li>\n<li>Discuss bullying with their classes to ensure athletes understand bullying, the consequences\nof bullying and the importance of telling an adult.</li>\n<li>Be alert to signs of distress and bullying.</li>\n<li>Listen to children/ young people who have been bullied, always take what they say seriously,\nrecord and act to support and protect them.</li>\n<li>Talk with the child accused of bullying to determine the nature of bullying.</li>\n<li>Report suspected cases of bullying to the head coach or child protection officer.</li>\n<li>Follow up any complaint from a parent on bullying and report back promptly with a report\non what action has been taken.</li>\n<li>Deal with incidents of bullying promptly and effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Responsibility of Athletes</h3>\n<p>Pupils in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the rules of Nemesis Cheer and Dance.</li>\n<li>Refrain from becoming involved in any type of bullying, in or outside of NCD classes, even\nwhen risking temporary unpopularity.</li>\n<li>Intervene to protect other children/ young people from bullying, unless unsafe to do so.</li>\n<li>Report to coaches any instance of witnesses or suspected bullying.</li>\n<li>Help create a climate where bullying is unacceptable.</li>\n<li>Value and respect everyone, other athletes, coaches, staff and volunteers.</li>\n<li>Help and support the achievements of others.</li>\n<li>Keep others safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victims of bullying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to suffer in silence.

There are four main types of abuse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neglect which includes failing to protect a child from exposure to any kind of danger, such\nas, starvation or cold. Neglect also includes persistent failure to carry out aspects of care,\nresulting in significant impairment of a child’s health or development.</li>\n<li>Physical injury which is deliberately inflicted, such as, biting, beating, burning or scalding.\nThis can also be a result of wilful neglect failing to prevent the child from being injured.</li>\n<li>Emotional abuse is any form of emotional ill treatment or rejection. Resulting in in-adverse\neffects emotional, physical and/or behavioural development of the child. This includes\nconstant criticism, continuously withholding approval or affection, severe discipline or a\ncomplete lack of appropriate control.</li>\n<li>Sexual abuse is the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents by involving them in\nsexual activities which they do not comprehend, are unable to give informed consent or\nviolate the social taboos of family roles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bullying</h2>\n<p>Bullying is a highly distressing and damaging form of abuse and is not tolerated at NCD. All staff and\nvolunteers are vigilant to signs of bullying and will take immediate steps to stop it happening,\nprotect and reassure the victim.</p>\n<p>Further guidance is available on bullying in our Anti-Bullying Policy.</p>\n<h2>Protection of Staff and Children</h2>\n<p>NCD recognises it’s responsibility to children, young people who take part in classes, as well as, staff\nand volunteers working with them. All members of staff, coaches and volunteers will be made aware\nof their responsibilities and what is expected of them. This includes the ode of conduct and\nbehaviour they are expected follow, the line of accountability in the organisation and the procedures\nthat need to be followed if there is an allegation of abuse.</p>\n<p>Parents are expected to work alongside coaches, staff and volunteers in relation to any concerns\nabout the behaviour of their child or young person. Dangerous or offensive behaviour of a child or\nyoung person, will be brought to the attention of the parents and persistent concerns could lead to\nthe suspension and removal of the child or young person from classes and their team.</p>\n<p>NCD is in receipt of public liability insurance covering accidents and allegations of harm cause by\ntheir coaches.</p>\n<p>The safety and protection of children is the responsibility of all involved, including coaches,\nvolunteers, junior coaches and parents. The aim of NCD is to work together to the children and\nyoung people participating in classes will be given the best possible opportunities and ensure they\nhave the best possible safe guards against accident or harm, while allowing them to grow\nemotionally.</p>\n<h2>How Abuse Comes to Light</h2>\n<p>Staff can become aware of abuse through direct disclosure of the victim, through someone the\nvictim has confided in passes this information on. This is second hand information and can be more\ncomplicated. Allegations can also arise through rumour or overheard comments. Each of these have\ntheir involvement different considerations. Any allegations of abuse should be made to the\ndesignated child protection officer.\nOn receiving allegations of abuse\nIf a coach, volunteer or other member of staff receives a disclosure of abuse from a child, or a report\nfrom a third party (including another child) or observed behaviour or a conversation which causes\nconcern that abuse may have occurred, it is their responsibility to act to ensure protection of the\nchild.</p>\n<p><strong>If you suspect abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, for reasons other than being told</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should report your concerns to the designated child protection officer or if unavailable\nthe coach in charge of the session. To discuss your concerns.</li>\n<li>Record your concerns as quickly as possible, to help with accuracy of timing later.</li>\n<li>The child protection officer should contact social services to seek their advice and decide on\nhow to contact the police and contact any other necessary child protection agencies.

Coaching Policy","weight":1,"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>At Nemesis Cheer and Dance we pride ourselves in offering as many opportunities as\npossible to our athletes. This includes providing our senior athletes with the chance\nto gain coaching experience and qualifications during their enrolment at our club.\nJunior coaching opportunities are taken seriously at the club negative behaviour will\nnot be accepted. These positions are unpaid, volunteering opportunities,\nwhich are made up of various roles and responsibilities outlined within this\npolicy.</p>\n<h2>Age Requirements for Junior Coaches</h2>\n<p>Junior coaches must be age 13 and up. Any athletes under this age who would like to\nbecome a junior coach in the future can express interest and come into class as a helper\nor to shadow a junior coach and get an idea of what is expected of them. Exceptions\nmay be made to the age policy if athletes show continued interest, maturity and\nleadership skills.</p>\n<h2>When can I start coaching?</h2>\n<p>Interest in coaching can be expressed at any time, however coaches will only be taken\non if they display level of maturity and behaviours etc expected of a junior coach.\nCoaching opportunities will also depend on the availability of positions in class and the\navailability of the candidate. This is because too many coaches in one session can\nroles/ jobs for them to take on, meaning they won’t be learning anything.</p>\n<h2>What is expected of a Junior Coach?</h2>\n<p>We expect our junior coaches to undertake certain roles and responsibilities at our club.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be available for at least two additional practice to your own. This may mean\ncoming in early before your class or an additional day.</li>\n<li>Arrive 15 minutes before class begins to greet the athletes as they arrive. Lead warm\nup, cool down and games activities.</li>\n<li>Participate in elements of classes with the athletes.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate skills during the class.</li>\n<li>Spot athletes through skills (training will be provided).</li>\n<li>Set up, tidy up and clean equipment.</li>\n<li>Set a good example of behaviour for younger athletes and their peers by following\nthe club code of conduct rules and behaving in a responsible and mature manner.</li>\n<li>Help out at events, such as fundraisers and competitions.</li>\n<li>Help with content for social media, such as TikTok Share ideas for routines, games,\nclass drills etc.</li>\n<li>To attend classes on a regular basis and let the head coach know at least two hours\nin advance if unable to attend. Ideally a week before so other arrangements can be\nmade.</li>\n<li>Set a good example for younger athletes in regards to behaviour and class etiquette.</li>\n<li>To ask if they are unsure or feel they need any support in any aspect of their role.</li>\n<li>To ensure all aspects of the building are kept tidy/ clean.</li>\n<li>Support all athletes in their learning journey, encouraging them to continue working\nand pushing towards their skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Junior coaching is not</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An excuse to use a phone during class.</li>\n<li>A reason to boss friends around.</li>\n<li>Something to brag about in school.</li>\n<li>Something to argue about.</li>\n<li>A reason to shout at team mates/ younger kids.</li>\n<li>A reason to mess around during any of the classes.</li>\n<li>A reason to distract the younger athletes when they should be listening/ working.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Junior coaches should not exhibit the tendencies listed above, if they do they will have\na meeting with their coach and if they continue negative behaviour they may be asked\nto take a step back from the coaching programme.</p>\n<h2>What Can Junior Coaches Expect From Nemesis?</h2>\n<p>In addition to the roles and responsibilities our junior coaches have there are also several\nbenefits to the role:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After a probation period of 4 months (without missing a coaching session) a discount\nis applied to class fees. Coaches will attend class for £16 per four weeks instead of £20.</li>\n<li>This is an opportunity to develop lifelong skills, build confidence and inspire others.</li>\n<li>After 6 months coaching (full attendance) athletes will be eligible for a junior\ncoaching course/ qualification, subject to availability. This will be paid for by the club.</li>\n<li>Occasional free Nemesis merchandise.</li>\n<li>Coaching experience looks great on CV’s, we will also provide references if required.</li>\n<li>Full support and training from the club.</li>\n<li>Opportunities to develop skills in child protection/ safeguarding and first aid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Ideal Junior Coach</h2>\n<p>The ideal junior coach is someone who behaves in a mature and responsible way. A\njunior coach needs to have the following qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dedication – Anyone not attending their own classes regularly will not be\nconsidered for junior coaching.</li>\n<li>Confidence – A junior coach needs to have the confidence to lead a group, such\nas their own class for warm up.</li>\n<li>Willing to learn – Coach’s must be willing to take instruction and constructive\ncriticism in order to learn and improve coaching technique.</li>\n<li>Hard working – Junior coaches must be willing to show they are working hard in\ntheir own class. This means working on tumbling/ stunts rather than messing\naround.</li>\n<li>Maturity – We do expect junior coaches to display a level of maturity meaning\nthey are not talking about others behind their back, not arguing with members\nof their team and are kind to everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you start coaching you will also need to have patience, kindness and authority\nwith the children.</p>\n<h2>The junior coaching process</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Express interest as a coach. Get a parent or guardian to fill in the parental sign off\nform.</li>\n<li>Have a meeting with Coach and possibly other junior coaches to get more of an\nunderstanding of your role.</li>\n<li>Outline coaching availability.</li>\n<li>Begin work on junior coaches work booklet (this is a lengthy booklet and will require\ndedication). Begin shadowing another junior coach for at least 6 weeks.</li>\n<li>Continue to work through your booklet and have regular check in with your coach\nto monitor your progress and go over anything you are unsure of.</li>\n<li>When confident enough begin coaching on your own, whilst continuing to work\nthrough booklet.</li>\n<li>After 4 months of consistent coaching discounted rate is applied to fees.</li>\n<li>After 6 months of consistent coaching your coach will begin looking into coaching\ncourses to get you qualified (If you are not quite ready for a coaching course after 6\nmonths you will not be sent on one).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Changes in Availability</h2>\n<p>If coaching availability changes we will do our best to accommodate junior coaches and\nbring them in on an alternative day. Provided we are not already over staffed with\ncoaches that day.</p>\n<h3>What happens if you do not fulfil your role as junior coach?</h3>\n<p>Please note a junior coaching role is not to come in and play around with the younger\nkids junior coaching is a very important role within the club and should only be taken on\nby those willing to take it seriously. It also costs the club a lot of money to get a junior\ncoach qualified. Junior coaching is hard work but does also offer a lot of rewards.\nAthletes who set a bad example for younger children or are not attending their classes\nmay have this opportunity removed.</p>\n<h3>What if I decide I don’t want to be a junior coach anymore?</h3>\n<p>Junior coaching is not for everyone. If you do decide it is not for you all we ask if that\nyou let us know as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy reviewed 19th June 2022 by Shania Watton</strong></p>\n<p>Download a PDF version of the Junior Coaching Policy <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_SBN4eGfAUoqQlA0-N1HWpGZrnAhecEV/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/faq/","relativePath":"docs/faq/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/faq","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Family Rates and Multiple Classes","excerpt":"Family Rates and Discounts information.","template":"docs"},"html":"<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hknwUGk02g1mH16A8WylflJny3i6alGu/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">information pack</a> for multiple class / family discount rates.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/coaching-opportunities/","relativePath":"docs/coaching-opportunities/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/coaching-opportunities","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Competition Info","excerpt":"Information on our cheer competitions.","template":"docs"},"html":"<p>Before considering any of our competition teams please remember it is a larger commitment both time wise and financially.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>Competition teams are open to boys and girls aged 4+.
