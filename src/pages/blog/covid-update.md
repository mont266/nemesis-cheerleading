**Covid update**

Following the recent update to covid government guidelines and the restrictions imposed on local businesses, we have made the decision to close the studio until January 2021. 

Pre recorded online classes will still be available until Christmas break, meaning our last online class will go live one the 14th December. Payment information is available for these classes on request.

New members are more than welcome to join our Online classes, if you would like more information please get in touch. 

We are working from home and will stil be available to answer any queries or questions during this time, as well as signing up new members and providing more information soon on new merchandise etc.

We very much look forward to seeing all of our athletes and Welcoming new members in January. 

Thank you for your continued support, especially during this time.
