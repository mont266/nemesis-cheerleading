## Why have tryouts?
Tryouts give children an opportunity to show of their skills, and will also give the coaches the chance to pair them into stunt groups to see which groups would work well together. For many of the kids this will be their first opportunity to stunt.

## How will the team works?
All kids will be allocated teams in terms of their age. Some children my be eligible for cross over or interested in stunt groups, they are welcome to try out for more than one team. Parents should remember if they are successful for their second team, this will be treated as an additional class cost plus additional competition fees. Each parent will be asked to leave an email address which is how they will be contacted with the team news.
