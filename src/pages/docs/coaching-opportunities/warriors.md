For ages 4-6.

Warriors is our Tiny competitive team for kids age 4-6. 

While this is a competitive team we have regular intervals of games, as well as working on our competition team in order to keep it fun. This team is a beginners team suitable for kids with no experience. Kids are expected to attend this class regularly.
