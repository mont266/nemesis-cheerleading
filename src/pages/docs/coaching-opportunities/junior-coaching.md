Our coaching staffs at Nemesis Cheer and Dance want to provide as many opportunities as possible to our athletes. Seniors athletes will be provide with the chance to gain coaching experience and qualifications, through participation at Nemesis! 


Our assistant/ junior coaches will be expected to display maturity, responsibility, patience, reliability and use their own initiative and communication skills. As well as setting a good example for the children they are coaching. Junior coaches will help coach younger classes and will have responsibilities, including:

+ Arriving before class to help set up equipment and welcome children as they arrive.

+ Sit with the children during warm up.

+ Demonstrate basic shapes and skills while the head coach explains them.

+ Help ensure children’s safety by engaging and aware of what’s going on.

+ Help manage negative behaviour.

+ Join in with the cool down and games at the end of class.

+ Attend classes reliably and let the rad coach know in advance if they cannot attend.


## Benefits

+ Coaching experiences looks great on CV’s, UCAS applications and job applications.

+ Coaching qualifications.

+ Child protection and first aid training.

+ Free Nemesis merchandise. 


## The downside

+ These positions are an unpaid, volunteering basis.

+ Requires commitment from you to attend your selected class each week.

+ If we have a large in date of junior coaches we will not be able to accept them all at one time, therefore it may take a little while for opportunities to become available.

+ Not all coaches can be put through qualifications at once coaches who show the most dedication will get qualified first.


## Requirements

+ You must be age 14 or over.

+ Fill in the application form attached and email it to Nemesischeeranddance@gmail.com or bring it class.
