During the current times, COVID-19 is having a huge impact on all of our lives and is forcing teams and businesses to operate a little differently than normal. Below are some of the steps that we are taking to ensure that anyone attending our classes are kept safe and that we are following current government guidelines.

<hr />

## Face Coverings

Face coverings are required in communal areas of the building, unless medically exempt.

<hr />

## Waiting in the building during class

Parents/Guardians cannot wait around the studio during classes. You must drop your child off and pick them up at the end of class. We are operating a drop off only system.

<hr />

## Contactless Payments

Where possible, we would recommend paying via Paypal prior to class. However, cash and card payments will both be accepted.

<hr />

## Registration Forms
If possible, please complete your registration form before the first class. This must be filled in to allow your child to participate. If completed before hand it would limit the amount of contact our coaches have with paper etc.

<hr />

## Toys

Toys are not permitted in class, to limit contact of children with each other.

<hr />

## Cleaning

There will be 15 minute intervals between classes to allow time for cleaning.

<hr />

## Equipment/Stunting

Equipment usage/sharing will be minimal and theer will be no stunting to aid in social distancing.

<hr />

## Clothing

Please ensure your child is dressed in comfortable clothes and shoes, suitable for sport, as changing rooms will not be available.

<hr />

## Water Bottles

Please ensure your child has water with them as we will not supply bottles and children will most likely need water throughout the class and will be given a water break if needed.

<hr />

## Hand Sanitiser

Hand Sanitiser will be provided on entry and exit of the classes.

<hr />

## Food

Please do not bring any outside food into the studio.

<hr />

## Athlete Face Coverings

Coaches will be wearing face coverings during class. Athletes are not required to wear face coverings but if they feel more comfortable, they are more than welcome to wear one.

<hr />

## Floor Markings

The floor is marked out to ensure social distancing, please also follow the one way system in the studio by entering and exiting through the correct door.

<hr />

## Covid-19 Symptoms
