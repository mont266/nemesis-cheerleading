  <strong>Definition of Bullying:</strong> 
  “Deliberately hurtful behaviour, repeated over a period of time, where it is difficult for the
victim to defend him or herself” (department of education, 1999).
“Seek to harm intimidate or coerce, someone perceived as vulnerable.” (Oxford Dictionary,
2020).
“The repeated use of power by one or more persons intentionally to harm, hurt or adversely
affect the rights or needs of another or others.” (Northern Ireland Anti-Bullying Forum).

## Impact of Bullying

If unchecked bullying can impair a child’s ability to learn, develop and participate in classes.

Bullying also impacts a child’s right to protection from all forms of violence, including mental
and physical violence.
The most commonly recognised type of bullying is by children’s peers. However, it is also
important to note that bullying can take place between adults and children, as well as
individuals and groups. Bullying methods can be face to face, indirectly or using cyber-
bullying methods. All methods of bullying are unacceptable.

Bullying is the abuse of power where the person being bullied finds it difficult to reject or
deal with offending behaviour or those bullying have more power over the victim. Power
imbalances can be subtle and build up over time. Common examples of power imbalances
include being stronger, older, bigger, have more friends, are more established within the
club/ school or care less about the consequences of their actions.

Bullying thrives in secrecy, the reluctance of the victim not to talk about it and the lack of
knowledge from responsible adults that this is taking place. Nemesis Cheer and Dance (NCD)
have a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for their
participants.
NCD is completely opposed to all forms of bullying. Bullying will not be tolerated at this club.

Bullying is a complete contradiction of the aims and values of NCD.
This policy is designed alongside NCD Child Protection and club rules.

## How Bullying Affects the Target/Victim
Bullied children will not always be prepared to tell those in authority. However, when a disclosure is
made, it should be treated seriously. While others may not feel certain that certain actions or words
are of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat
the case as bullying. Bullying can result in a decrease in the victim’s capacity to learn and develop.

## Signs of Bullying
+ Unwillingness to come to class.
+ Withdrawn, isolated behaviour.
+ Refusal to talk about problems.
+ Complaining about missing possessions.
+ Avoiding interaction with peers, such as hanging back on breaks.
+ Nail biting, flinching, jumpiness, distracted behaviour.
+ Illness caused by stress, loss of sleep and change in eating habits.
+ Out of character aggression or temper.
+ Attempts to inflict harm on them self.
(These behaviours can be symptomatic of other problems, that aren’t bullying related).

## Consequences of Bullying
+ Bullying can have detrimental effects on the victim. NCD staff will do everything they can to ensure
incidents of bullying are not repeated. Incidents of bullying could result in the bully:
+ Being given targets to improve their unsociable behaviour.
+ Both children being interviewed to determine the form of bullying.
+ Support to both the victim and the bully, to improve their behaviour.
+ Repeated incidents of serious bullying could result in the removal of the bully from class.

## How we aim to help the target/ victim
NCD has a responsibility to create a supportive and disciplined environment which will foster the
individual development and caring for children and young people. NCD aims to do this by:

+ Creating a supportive environment

+ Bullying investigations will involve both the bully and the bullied and will aim to resolve
these issues as best as possible.
