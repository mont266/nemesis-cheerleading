## Statement of Intent
It is the intent of Nemesis Cheerleading and Dance to safeguard, the welfare of all children and
vulnerable people involved in the club activities in relation to accident and harm. This organisation
aims to ensure a safe, supportive environment, inclusive to all athletes. Staff, leaders and helpers/
volunteers (including those under eighteen years old who may assist adult coaches) involved in any
activity associated with the organisation are expected to display respect and understanding for the
rights, welfare and safety of the children and vulnerable adults in their care and to conduct
themselves in a manor that reflects the principles of Nemesis Cheerleading and Dance (NCD). Care
will be taken to reduce risk of accident and injury to a minimum and protect children/ vulnerable
adults from physical, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse while in the care and responsibility of NCD.
Planned procedures will be used to support children in the care of NCD, therefore, outside agencies
may be involved where necessary.

The senior coach (who will always be age eighteen or over) will be responsible for the supervision of
any assistant coaches and volunteers during classes and activities. This policy will be available to all
parents, volunteers, coaches and senior participants/ athletes. To ensure everyone can raise
concerns or complaints and the procedure for responding to this.

## Principles this Policy is built on
+ Children have a right to be protected from all forms of violence, to be kept safe from harm
and given proper care.
+ Children have a right to be heard, listened to and taken seriously.
+ We have a responsibility towards the children and vulnerable adults in our care and should
take all responsible steps to ensure their safety and their welfare is safe guarded.
+ Staff and volunteers at NCD have a responsibility to be alert to signs of abuse and follow
procedures in cases of suspected or alleged abuse.
+ NCD have a responsibility to co-operate fully with other agencies involved in child protection
and to follow procedures of abuse.

## Definition and Recognition of Child Abuse
Children may be abused by a parent, guardian, sibling, other relative, carer (foster parent, staff
member at a residential home) an acquaintance or stranger, who may be an adult or a young
person. There are four main types of abuse:
+ Neglect which includes failing to protect a child from exposure to any kind of danger, such
as, starvation or cold. Neglect also includes persistent failure to carry out aspects of care,
resulting in significant impairment of a child’s health or development.
+ Physical injury which is deliberately inflicted, such as, biting, beating, burning or scalding.
This can also be a result of wilful neglect failing to prevent the child from being injured.
+ Emotional abuse is any form of emotional ill treatment or rejection. Resulting in in-adverse
effects emotional, physical and/or behavioural development of the child. This includes
constant criticism, continuously withholding approval or affection, severe discipline or a
complete lack of appropriate control.
+ Sexual abuse is the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents by involving them in
sexual activities which they do not comprehend, are unable to give informed consent or
violate the social taboos of family roles.

## Bullying
Bullying is a highly distressing and damaging form of abuse and is not tolerated at NCD. All staff and
volunteers are vigilant to signs of bullying and will take immediate steps to stop it happening,
protect and reassure the victim.

Further guidance is available on bullying in our Anti-Bullying Policy.

## Protection of Staff and Children
NCD recognises it’s responsibility to children, young people who take part in classes, as well as, staff
and volunteers working with them. All members of staff, coaches and volunteers will be made aware
of their responsibilities and what is expected of them. This includes the ode of conduct and
behaviour they are expected follow, the line of accountability in the organisation and the procedures
that need to be followed if there is an allegation of abuse.

Parents are expected to work alongside coaches, staff and volunteers in relation to any concerns
about the behaviour of their child or young person. Dangerous or offensive behaviour of a child or
young person, will be brought to the attention of the parents and persistent concerns could lead to
the suspension and removal of the child or young person from classes and their team.

NCD is in receipt of public liability insurance covering accidents and allegations of harm cause by
their coaches.

The safety and protection of children is the responsibility of all involved, including coaches,
volunteers, junior coaches and parents. The aim of NCD is to work together to the children and
young people participating in classes will be given the best possible opportunities and ensure they
have the best possible safe guards against accident or harm, while allowing them to grow
emotionally.
## How Abuse Comes to Light
Staff can become aware of abuse through direct disclosure of the victim, through someone the
victim has confided in passes this information on. This is second hand information and can be more
complicated. Allegations can also arise through rumour or overheard comments. Each of these have
their involvement different considerations. Any allegations of abuse should be made to the
designated child protection officer.
On receiving allegations of abuse
If a coach, volunteer or other member of staff receives a disclosure of abuse from a child, or a report
from a third party (including another child) or observed behaviour or a conversation which causes
concern that abuse may have occurred, it is their responsibility to act to ensure protection of the
child.

<strong>If you suspect abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, for reasons other than being told</strong>

+ You should report your concerns to the designated child protection officer or if unavailable
the coach in charge of the session. To discuss your concerns.
+ Record your concerns as quickly as possible, to help with accuracy of timing later.
+ The child protection officer should contact social services to seek their advice and decide on
how to contact the police and contact any other necessary child protection agencies. If for
some reason this is not done by the protection officer you should do this yourself.
+ Appropriate records should be kept by the child protection officer you may need to assist
them in completing these.
+ Do not investigate further, leave this to child protection professionals, who will follow
appropriate guidelines, who may wish to speak to you.

<strong>If a child reports allegations of abuse to you or gives you information about possible abuse of another child or vulnerable adult</strong>

+ Listen respectfully and carefully, accepting the information at face value, always believe
a child confiding in you.
+ Allow the child to speak without interrupting or attempting to investigate.
+ Support the child for giving you this information (to alleviate feelings of discomfort),
pass no judgement on what you have heard.
+ Inform the child that you will offer them as much support as possible but that you will
have to pass this information on to the child protection officer or relevant authorities.
+ Inform the child protection of what you have been told as soon as the situation warrants
to ensure appropriate action can be taken.
+ Record everything the child/ vulnerable adult said, as quickly as possible in as much
detail as possible. The child’s first disclosure is hearsay but is admissible as evidence in
court and you will be interviewed by a child protection professional, about what you
were told. Therefore, accurate recordings are necessary.
+ The child protection officer or failing that the coaching leading the session will inform
parents/ guardians of the concerns, unless the child objects or a close family member is
the alleged offender. In which case the child protection officer will coordinate with social
services and the police in how to advise the parents/ guardian of the concern.

#### Never tell the child/ vulnerable adult
+ That you won’t tell anyone something they are about to disclose to you. You have a
responsibility to follow necessary guidelines and pass this on to the designated child
protection officer.
+ You cannot promise a child that the abuse will never happen again, because again you
cannot make false promises to a child and you cannot guarantee this.
+ If a child shows lacerations, bruises etc you can sketch these, but under no lint should a
child’s clothing be removed.
+ Do not interrupt the child while they are disclosing information to you and while tactile
enquires can be made, you should not enquire to deeply. This is for child protection
professionals.

## Who to contact during allegations of abuse
Following concerns or allegations of abuse, the coach or volunteer will coordinate with the child
protection officer, who will report the facts as known to
+ Coleraine Childcare office, Castlerock Road, Coleraine. 70352221
+ Ballymoney childcare team, Newall Road, Ballymoney. 27664101
+ The Out of Hours Social Work Service. 94468833
+ Coleraine Police Care Unit. 70344122

Advice given by these respective professionals should then be followed.

## Independent Professional Advisor
In all cases NCD may wish to avail outside professional advice, without using identifying information,
to help establish what is the safest and most balanced way of managing any specific situation that
may arise.

## Recruitment of Volunteers/ Junior Coaches
Any individual who wishes to participate as a volunteer or junior coach in any NCD classes or
activities must complete the application form, supplied on request, providing the information

would be expected of the child’s level of development may indicate sexual abuse.
+ Children who are being sexually abused don’t necessarily display any behavioural
disturbances.
+ For many children some of the above symptoms will be present and are not always
associated with abuse.
