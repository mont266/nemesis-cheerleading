Registration Fees of <strong>£25</strong> apply to all athletes, second child is <strong>£15</strong>. These fees must be paid before your child can participate in any classes.

Any current club members registration fee from our previous term will roll over, as a one off, due to lack of classes because of COVID-19. However, they will have to pay a deposit to secure their place in class.

Classes will be paid in four weekly payments and must be paid in full. There are no pay as you go classes.

If classes are not paid the week they are due then a 10% late fee will be added on to the price of payment.

Four weeks must be paid in full even if your child will miss a week as this cost is required to secure their space.

We cannot provide refunds once payment has been made for class fees.

Competition fees cannot be refunded because they go straight to the event organisers.
