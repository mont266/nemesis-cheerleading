Please ensure that your child is suitably dressed for sport (Comfy clothes, no jeans). Suitable shoes such as trainers or cheer shoes must be worn, not sandals.

It is also very important they do not bring any toys, especially with COVID-19 regulations. 

Please ensure they have a drink, preferably water, as they will need it.

Please remove any jewellery and chewing gum before class as this is a safety concern.
