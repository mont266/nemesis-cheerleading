## Payments
+ All class payments MUST be paid on the due date for each term by either card, cash
payment or via PayPal.
+ Registration fees must be paid in full.
+ Pay as you go classes are not an option, classes are paid by four weeks only.
+ If you know you are going to miss a class you must pay for this class to ensure your
child’s space is maintained.
+ Refunds are not provided for missed classes.
+ Payment must be made for all classes in the term to reserve your child’s place in
class.
+ If class payments are not made the week they are due a 10% late fee will be added
to your bill. If the bill remains unpaid your child will not be able to return to class,
their space will be filled with someone from the waiting list.
+ Payments must be made upfront for Nemesis Cheer and Dance T shirts, hoodies,
costumes and any other merchandise.
+ It is ultimately your responsibility to ensure your child has any competition fees,
uniform fees etc paid on time. If these are not paid by the allocated date your child
will not be able to compete. We do not set these deadlines and cannot have the rest
of the team miss out due to one child.

## In the gym
+ Children are not permitted into the gym more than 5 minutes before the class start
time. The doors will be locked until this time.
+ Nemesis Cheer and Dance requests that parents do not remain in the studio during
class time and do not enter the gym than before the end of the previous class.
+ Athletes in tiny, mini, youth and junior classes must have a parent/ guardian collect
them from inside the gym. Senior athletes can leave themselves if parents would
prefer for us not to let them out just let us know.
+ Parents need to let coaching staff know if it is going to be someone other than
themselves picking up their child. Or if there is anyone they do not want picking up
their child.
+ Athletes must wear appropriate clothing during class, no denim shorts, no skirts.
+ Cheer shoes should not be worn outside.
+ Athletes long hair must be tied back this is a hazard.
+ Chewing gum is not permitted in the gym.
+ All jewellery must be removed before class.
+ Nemesis Cheer and Dance and staff will not be held responsible for athlete’s
jewellery or any other belongings that may be lost or forgotten.
+ Water or diluted juice only is to be brought to the gym.
+ The use of mobile phones is not permitted during class.
+ Eating is not permitted during class.
+ We cannot supply water, as the only running water we have is the bathroom and we
have no cups/ bottles, so if your child has no drink they will not be able to get one.
This is your responsibility.

## Nemesis Cheer and Dance Class
+ Any athletes who wish to progress to competition teams must be able to committee
fully to extra competition classes required, as well as display a level of commitment
to the team and skills required for the level of the team.

where it is deemed necessary. Competitive cheerleaders can be moved into different

with USASF age group for competition teams.
