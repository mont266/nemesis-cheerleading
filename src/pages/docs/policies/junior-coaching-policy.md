At Nemesis Cheer and Dance we pride ourselves in offering as many opportunities as
possible to our athletes. This includes providing our senior athletes with the chance
to gain coaching experience and qualifications during their enrolment at our club.
Junior coaching opportunities are taken seriously at the club negative behaviour will
not be accepted. These positions are unpaid, volunteering opportunities,
which are made up of various roles and responsibilities outlined within this
policy.

## Age Requirements for Junior Coaches
Junior coaches must be age 13 and up. Any athletes under this age who would like to
become a junior coach in the future can express interest and come into class as a helper
or to shadow a junior coach and get an idea of what is expected of them. Exceptions
may be made to the age policy if athletes show continued interest, maturity and
leadership skills.

## When can I start coaching?
Interest in coaching can be expressed at any time, however coaches will only be taken
on if they display level of maturity and behaviours etc expected of a junior coach.
Coaching opportunities will also depend on the availability of positions in class and the
availability of the candidate. This is because too many coaches in one session can
roles/ jobs for them to take on, meaning they won’t be learning anything.

## What is expected of a Junior Coach?
We expect our junior coaches to undertake certain roles and responsibilities at our club.
These include:
+ To be available for at least two additional practice to your own. This may mean
coming in early before your class or an additional day.
+ Arrive 15 minutes before class begins to greet the athletes as they arrive. Lead warm
up, cool down and games activities.
+ Participate in elements of classes with the athletes.
+ Demonstrate skills during the class.
+ Spot athletes through skills (training will be provided).
+ Set up, tidy up and clean equipment.
+ Set a good example of behaviour for younger athletes and their peers by following
the club code of conduct rules and behaving in a responsible and mature manner.
+ Help out at events, such as fundraisers and competitions.
+ Help with content for social media, such as TikTok Share ideas for routines, games,
class drills etc.
+ To attend classes on a regular basis and let the head coach know at least two hours
in advance if unable to attend. Ideally a week before so other arrangements can be
made.
+ Set a good example for younger athletes in regards to behaviour and class etiquette.
+ To ask if they are unsure or feel they need any support in any aspect of their role.
+ To ensure all aspects of the building are kept tidy/ clean.
+ Support all athletes in their learning journey, encouraging them to continue working
and pushing towards their skills.

## Junior coaching is not
+ An excuse to use a phone during class.
+ A reason to boss friends around.
+ Something to brag about in school.
+ Something to argue about.
+ A reason to shout at team mates/ younger kids.
+ A reason to mess around during any of the classes.
+ A reason to distract the younger athletes when they should be listening/ working.

Junior coaches should not exhibit the tendencies listed above, if they do they will have
a meeting with their coach and if they continue negative behaviour they may be asked
to take a step back from the coaching programme.

## What Can Junior Coaches Expect From Nemesis?
In addition to the roles and responsibilities our junior coaches have there are also several
benefits to the role:
+ After a probation period of 4 months (without missing a coaching session) a discount
is applied to class fees. Coaches will attend class for £16 per four weeks instead of £20.
+ This is an opportunity to develop lifelong skills, build confidence and inspire others.
+ After 6 months coaching (full attendance) athletes will be eligible for a junior
coaching course/ qualification, subject to availability. This will be paid for by the club.
+ Occasional free Nemesis merchandise.
+ Coaching experience looks great on CV’s, we will also provide references if required.
+ Full support and training from the club.
+ Opportunities to develop skills in child protection/ safeguarding and first aid.

## The Ideal Junior Coach
The ideal junior coach is someone who behaves in a mature and responsible way. A
junior coach needs to have the following qualities:
+ Dedication – Anyone not attending their own classes regularly will not be
considered for junior coaching.
+ Confidence – A junior coach needs to have the confidence to lead a group, such
as their own class for warm up.
+ Willing to learn – Coach’s must be willing to take instruction and constructive
criticism in order to learn and improve coaching technique.
+ Hard working – Junior coaches must be willing to show they are working hard in
their own class. This means working on tumbling/ stunts rather than messing
around.
+ Maturity – We do expect junior coaches to display a level of maturity meaning
they are not talking about others behind their back, not arguing with members
of their team and are kind to everyone.

When you start coaching you will also need to have patience, kindness and authority
with the children.

## The junior coaching process
1. Express interest as a coach. Get a parent or guardian to fill in the parental sign off
form.
2. Have a meeting with Coach and possibly other junior coaches to get more of an
understanding of your role.
3. Outline coaching availability.
4. Begin work on junior coaches work booklet (this is a lengthy booklet and will require
dedication). Begin shadowing another junior coach for at least 6 weeks.
5. Continue to work through your booklet and have regular check in with your coach
to monitor your progress and go over anything you are unsure of.
6. When confident enough begin coaching on your own, whilst continuing to work
through booklet.
7. After 4 months of consistent coaching discounted rate is applied to fees.
8. After 6 months of consistent coaching your coach will begin looking into coaching
courses to get you qualified (If you are not quite ready for a coaching course after 6
months you will not be sent on one).

## Changes in Availability
If coaching availability changes we will do our best to accommodate junior coaches and
bring them in on an alternative day. Provided we are not already over staffed with
coaches that day.

### What happens if you do not fulfil your role as junior coach?
Please note a junior coaching role is not to come in and play around with the younger
kids junior coaching is a very important role within the club and should only be taken on
by those willing to take it seriously. It also costs the club a lot of money to get a junior
coach qualified. Junior coaching is hard work but does also offer a lot of rewards.
Athletes who set a bad example for younger children or are not attending their classes
may have this opportunity removed.

### What if I decide I don’t want to be a junior coach anymore?
Junior coaching is not for everyone. If you do decide it is not for you all we ask if that
you let us know as soon as possible.
