This class is perfect for beginners age 4-6, open to both boys and girls! 

We spend our classes working on different dance styles, including, Pom, hip hop and cheer dance, We also work on cheerleading jumps and tumbling technique. As well as playing games and carrying out fun activities to help children develop their all important fundamentals of sport, like improving their balance and jumping. Our kids work with a star chart to reward hard work and good behaviour and will receive certificates with newly completed skills at special points in the year such as Christmas and summer break! We aim to accommodate children of all levels, this class is perfect for kids with no cheer or dance experience, but also for children who have experience and want to try something new while having fun!
