Our age 7-10 class is all about having fun and gaining new skills! 

This class is recreationally based and caters for a variety of different levels from little to no experience, right the way through! Our class gives kids a chance to work with Pom Poms, meet other kids and learn a variety of different cheerleading elements including jumps and tumbling. As well as, cheer dance, Pom dance and hip hop. Our class also focuses on helping children have fun and interact with each other through our games and activities! This class also works with a star chart programme to reward their hard work and good behaviour, along with presentation of certificates at the end of some of our terms, such as christmas! Perfect for any child that wants to try something new or get more experience and confidence in cheerleading.
