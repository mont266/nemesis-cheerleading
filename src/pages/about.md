Nemesis Cheer and Dance is a local cheerleading club in Coleraine. The club was established with the aim of providing an inclusive environment for children and young people to learn and participate in cheer and dance. Our coaches aim to not only help every athlete in our care, develop cheerleading skills, but also develop their confidence, help them make friends and develop skills that can be applied to all life aspects. As well as having fun.
